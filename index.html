			<h1>Chapter1

				Outsider

				<p>
					Legend has it, that young kids adapt easily.  A young nine year-old kid, travels to Canada to learn. Education is the key to a person’s wisdom; wisdom is the most important thing about an individual. Wise people always put people into great paths, they help people treat their problems, but what if you’re wise enough to guide yourself, being able to help yourself in all your problems without taking any unnecessary action is a skill everyone needs to have. Education this the best way into wisdom. But education wasn’t the only reason my family and I traveled to Canada! Canada is a great country. We lived there for two years.<br>First year was sort of troubling, as I traveled to a country that speaks another language. And my brother was born a few months later. The first day of school, a sunny morning and the excitement has taken over the apartment. In class , a classmate came up to me and asked me in Arabic -Arabic is my mother tongue language- if I was from Saudi Arabia, and I happily answered yes, due to having another Saudi or an Arabic speaking individual in the class, I was really happy, his name is Abdulrahman. Abdulrahman helped me learn English, helped me to communicate with other students, helped me make new friends, he’s an amazing individual and a friend.<br>I was put in a class with a female teacher, Mrs. Richard was her name. Mrs. Richard was a great teacher and was more than happy to help me learn English and took my condition into consideration. My younger sister was in the same school, she’s two years younger than me, that means she’s in Kindergarten two, which puts me in year two. Her teacher was Mrs. Kelly. In that year my sister was also getting help from another Saudi student, that student happened to be Abdulrahman’s sister-likely for us. I used to worry about my sister a lot, because I was trying to fit in with my classmates, I was worried about her going through the same thing, Mrs. Kelly after awhile got frustrated due to me repeatedly interrupting her classes-Afterall I was only looking after my sister.<br>My mother went to college to better her English, so she could help us. On her way, she made friends, from one friend to another, until they made a group. Every Friday after school, my mother would take my sister and I with her to her friends, we also made friends, we socialized. Later that year those friends moved into our school, which made our lives easier and made us happier. My sister and I had the same gym teacher, and our first year gym teacher was amazing and funny. Mr. Lucas I believe was his name. Mr. Lucas was all about having fun during the PE lesson, dancing, playing basketball, playing football-known in North America as soccer-, any fun sport, he made sure we played and had fun, one of the best teachers ever to teach me.<br>Later that year, my family also wanted to explore Toronto as well as Canada as a whole. One of those places we went to was Great Wolf Lodge Water Park, in Niagara Falls, Canada. It was and still the best water park I went to. It was big, really big, it had all kinds of slides for adults and kids. It had swimming pools, it had those wave pools, and was fun and amazing. Unlike other water parks I went to, those wave pools really made it fun. It also had area for toddlers and areas for children from one year to three years old. It was fun for both boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, it made your normal topical summer into a fantastic summer vacation. But unfortunately like everything else, it had to have something that doesn’t fit the quality of the place. Their food! It wasn’t the best, but it wasn’t the type of food where you go like, ‘there’s no way in hell I’m eating that!’ or force it, which was really frustrating due to how much we loved the place. But their rooms were amazing; the furniture was in line with everything in the lodge. They had wooden walls, wooden beds, wooden couches, basically everything was wooden.<br>Speaking of great things or places, Muskoka! Muskoka is one of the-if not the best-place in Canada! It’s known for its lakes and the green nature in it. Personally, I don’t really like using my time on looking at mother-nature and waterfalls and lakes-don’t get me wrong it’s amazing, but its not the thing I look forward for when I travel. Nevertheless, it was beautiful, a place I would recommend to everyone. The waterfalls were amazingly ocean blue. Its really amazing how god created such beautiful falls.<br>I said earlier that on Fridays, we used to go out with my mom’s friends. Sundays were the family’s day. We used to go to parks and walk around the city, going to the park on rainy days amazing, the weather was great and a there would be a little wind. One day my sister and I, saw these kids with scooters. We were amazed and shocked, they were amazing and looked really fun to play with. Instantly, we ran to my parents and asked for scooters just like the ones we saw. My father promised us he would buy us scooters, and when he made the promise my sister and I were as happy as quokka-A quokka is an animal found in Australia, lives in harsh conditions, but due to its friendly appearance, its named the happiest animal on earth. After a few days, my father was finally able to buy us the scooters and we were happy! We took the scooters all around the area, we memorized where everything was due to how many times, we would scale around the parks! Another thing that made us, a family, was happy was the food! There was a pizza restaurant nearby called, Pizza pizza, it is the best pizza I ever tasted! And there was this Greek restaurant that my parents dearly loved, and the best thing about the Greek restaurant was the mid-eastern food.<br>First school year finished great. I had great marks thanks to my friends and Mrs. Richard for helping me out, I made great friends, and had a lot of fun exploring Toronto. Second year starts, and I was put into the same teacher’s class, in other words, I was thrilled to have Mrs. Richard back, I was afraid of having another teacher and having to explain that its my second year and how they would need to help me out with test, quizzes, and homeworks. My sister got a new teacher, his name was Mr. Lucas-just like our gym teacher. But unfortunately, Mr. Lucas the gym teacher left the school and we got a new gym teacher. She was great, but not as fun as Mr. Lucas. Mr. Lucas-my sister’s teacher-I remember him for being the only bald guy in school, but nevertheless he was a great teacher, he was kind to my sister and I and helped us, and would always ask about how we’re doing. And lucky for me his class and Mrs. Richard class were a wall apart. Best part was that my sister is now on the same floor as mine, we would bump into each other often and we had breaks at the same time.<br>The school that year brought up an idea, which a lot of students liked. They would take a picture of you and print it on small keychains for a price. My sister and I really like the idea, but my father thought it was a waste of money, which to be honest, I can see how and why, but explain that to a ten-year-old and an eight-year-old kids, its impossible. I think my dad went like: this is a one-time thing, I’ll pay for it. To be honest, I really don’t know why he said yes, but thanks dad, you’re truly the best!<br>Around that time, iPhones came out, as I said earlier, after a few months of us moving to Canada, my brother was born. He grow up in the beginning era of iPhones. My mom would not stop videotaping him, it used to be cool-nowadays we have Snapchat.<br>My sister and I didn’t really like using iPhones or iPods growing up, but to be fair we had a gamming console, we also used to watch TV a lot. We watched the channel Treehouse a lot. I used to act like I was one of the characters on some of the shows they used to put on. One of the shows was ‘Mike The Knight’ he’s a young knight exploring the world with his sister and their pets. I used to watch TV a lot, and not so fun fact, I had to wear glasses.<br>Later that year it snowed! Canada is also known for its amazing snow, one of the reasons we love Canada is the snow. Snow is amazing, its that time of the year, where its cold but you can play outside and the world looks different and beautiful. I wish I tried to make a snowman, never really thought of it. But I used to make snowballs and throw them around. My father loved how we loved playing with the snow, in general my father was being a good father and making sure we all as a family were happy.<br>Unfortunately, every story has an ending, and our time in Canada is almost over, we went visiting our favorite places. Our furniture was a bit of a burden, because what should we do with it? It’s our first time having to get rid of furniture and plus its in other country. My father contacted a friend and he took care of it. And there was nothing more to take care of. And now, its time to move back. Canada was one of the best chapters of my life. </p>

				Chapter 2
				<br>
				Back To The Past
			</h1>
			<p>
				Back to home sweet home Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Coming back home is the sweetest thing a person can do. Home is where family gathers and where memories are created and where one’s character is formed. But coming back to Saudi after two years in Canada was hard, as there was the language difference and the educational difference, everything was different.<br>School paperwork problems came into action, as now I’m now in a Arabic speaking school and I came from a English speaking country, let alone school! Things were complicated, but everything went fine. Unfortunately, I became an outsider again. A grade four student, that just came back from a different part of the world. And my Arabic was bad, but most people can understand me, for the most part at least. Communication was hard, as I tried to communicate with other when I buy from the convention store.
				<br>Another issue was educational difference. The main issue I was facing when I was in fourth grade wasn’t the students, it was that I didn’t know how to read and write Arabic, I took year one in Riyadh which teaches you the basics of the basics to learning Arabic, and year two was in Toronto. Teachers helped me learn how to write and read, as will as my mother, and she played a big role in me learning, as she would make me text her a lot and she would make sure I would CORRECTLY spell each and every word, she also had other methods. Thanks to all of her methods, I correctly spell and read better than a lot of people-and sometimes I would correct high ranking people such as teachers.<br>People have a tradition of eating rice everyday for lunch and some would go as for lunch and dinner, don’t get me wrong, the rice is amazing, but that much is just too much, if you know what I mean. I used to be a skinny young kid, since I got back, I got overwhelmed from the great food and the amazing rice. Feeding that much food to a skinny young man or even a man is going to make that individual fat. So, as you guessed, I became fat. At first, I really didn’t care about it, but later on it became a problem.<br>My father started to notice the weight I was putting on, and started to make sure I knew of it. My father’s methods were eating me alive and I ate my way out of it, but looking back, I agree with his methods. But food is the greatest thing a human can have. Apart from skinny individuals, who don’t like eating REAL food, like rice, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, steaks, pastes, and cultural foods. I like whole foods, in other words foods that are filled with carbohydrates, so pizza, rice, and burgers were mostly my diet. Carbohydrates are needed for the body to function, but like anything in this world, too much of something is bad for you.<br>I encountered a few issues with my family, especially from my father’s side. I forgot a lot of my family members names, which was a big issue when I go to family gatherings with my father. Also talking to family members was hard. To talk to people who you don’t know you need self-confidence, it plays a big role on how you interact with the world around you, but my father’s family are great people, no one is left alone, in other words everyone needs to be in the picture, everyone needs to have fun, everyone needs to being laughing, everyone needs to be having a great time.  I got the same questions from all of my family members, from my mother’s side. Which to be honest, was kind of frustrating, but I still answered. Also a lot of them would ask me, what does this word mean in English? Or what does this English word mean? My mother’s family are great people, but there’s no one my age so that puts me and my first cousins alone, fun fact one of my first cousins from my mother’s side is also my cousin from my father’s side, but not first cousin.<br>What really amazed me, was how much families gather, I never heard of a family in my Canadian school that gathers half as much! I saw how much they valued family, not saying Canadians don’t value family, but it showed me how my family valued family.  One of my uncles used to love Snapchat, he would come up to me and my sister and record us and try to conversate with us in English. I used to be camara-shy, so I wouldn’t talk much or act as if I don’t know. Unlike my sister, which was more open to the camara, they would go on and on and on, just talking, and my uncle’s English was funny and I would correct him behind the scenes-if you wish. Nevertheless, he made translating and answering all those ridiculous questions fun.<br>Time goes by and my father buys a new car, it was shining black and looked amazing. Now we got a new car, we need an apartment, so my father looks for one and he found us the best apartment. We lived there for a few months until my father finishes the paperwork for our house. Later that year, finally all the paperwork is finished and its time to move in. Unfortunately, the people who rented our house, didn’t clean up their mess, which was absurd, but like the great man my father is, he took care of it. Now it was time to buy the house furniture. We go looking for living room furniture, which I found boring to be honest, but when it was time for my brother and I’s room, there was fun! We looked and looked and priced and priced, until we found the best furniture. Thanks to my dad, and my mother, our house looked amazing, and I know I use amazing a lot, but our house was something else!<br>Weather was sort of an issue, in Canada I was used to in mid-September or early-October to start wearing long-sleeves or even jackets, unlike in Riyadh this time of the year you’re still wearing shorts, but mid-November you start wearing long-sleeves. Winter wasn’t really an issue in Riyadh, and unfortunately, each year I don’t warm myself as much because, I would think, its not really cold, but as you guessed I got the seasonal fever each year, until a few years later, I started to take winter seriously.<br>A few years pass, and my father decides to move me to an English-speaking school, so I would keep my English language, and better my mark, as they weren’t the best. Coming back from Canada and meeting my family again was amazing to say the least.

					Chapter 3
				<br>
					Back From The Past
			</h1>
			<p>
				From Saudi Arabia to Canada then back to Saudi Arabia then to an English-speaking part of Saudi Arabia, really messed with my head. But it was the best decision my father has made! Being able to speak English and talk the language made me feel me. I think it has to deal with the fact I grow up in Canada and my brain still hasn’t processed the fact that I am back in Riyadh. But switching to an English culture school had its consequences.<br>A kid in the western world would get bullied for being fat or as they call it nowadays, ‘fat-shaming’. So being in a school with a western culture, I got bullied a lot. I was once again an outsider! As a twelve-year-old, your brain starts developing new hormones which you haven’t experienced, and that’s why twelve and thirteen-year-olds get moody and problematic but after a while they’re back to normal. So, experiencing these hormones can make an individual feel that the world is against them. But what if other factors play a role with those hormones and really put you down? Bulling is one of these factors, and I got bullied, left and right, up and down. I got beat up once or ganged up on by fellow classmates, that time was horrible, but I look up to my role model and how he deals with problems, he just moves on. My father, my friend, my hero, doesn’t show his weaknesses, deals with his problems and doesn’t let them affect him in his life. I decided to be just like him, and I added my thing, which is putting that frustration into either studying or reading or writing or exercising, whatever it was, I was not going to let my problems interfere with my life. Read ‘Using bad energy’ for more on overcoming bulling.<br>Physical pain can be recovered easily, but emotional pain isn’t. Emotional pain is hard to deal with, it takes a strong individual to defeat that pain. You can live with It, but to overcome it and go on like if your emotions were never hurt, that itself is pain. I had great teachers in the school, they were teachers in class and friends outside of class. And I had teachers who were, just teachers, and had teachers who I would call enemies. Thankfully those enemy teachers, I only had a few times a week, but one of them would done anything to get me into trouble, I was to be a young man that would forget everything that happened to him. So, I would forget, but the anger and rage use still there, I would remember it’s because of something that happened between the teacher and I. One time I got really frustrated, I bursted at him in Arabic, which he wouldn’t understand. A bully in class toke it as an opportunity, and told the teacher what I said. So, the teacher emailed the principle and my father, the principle set up a meeting with my father and the teacher and I to talk about why this happened. Likely for him, I forgot everything, which means I can’t make a point against him in an argument.<br>The meeting finished as him being the rectitude individual and I was interpreted as the problematic young man. It really frustrated me, but I toke a step back, and let life be life, and just went on.<br>Life sometimes just punches you in face and you can either protect yourself and try to swing back, but risk being badly punched, or just stand there protecting yourself. And I choose to protect myself against life. Life has been punching me, even when we travel. As a fat young man, your body is growing up, which means you need to feed it, but being a young man and fat are two things that say give me every dish on the menu. I hated eating when traveling, because I would love to eat big meals, but I can’t because I would look like a hungry wild lion. Nevertheless, I always made sure I got enough food to feed my big stomach.<br>Like every year, a few days before we travel, my mother, announces where we’re going to travel, and when I heard the news, I was as happy as a quokka! We were going to Canada! We visited a lot of great places, new places and old places. We had the time of our lives. Thankfully it was summer, and summer in Canada is a not really hot, so you’re not cold, but you’re not sweating. Canada time is finished and now its time to go back home. We’re back home, and its time to see our family after a month. My grandparents and aunts and cousins said that they noticed, our tan, and they noticed my sister’s weight loss, which was really absurd due to my sister already being light-weighted. So, next morning comes and I decide to take off my shirt and see how I look and how to change it. I take it off and there I was shocked and staring in disbelieve.<br>I surprisingly lost weight! That was amazing. Couldn’t believe what happened.<br>Motivated by the surprising weight loss, or fat loss, I decided to live healthy, and start working out. I started doing sit-ups and pushups for days then weeks the months, but no change happened, all what happened was I look heavier! Which really demotivated me, but I searched the internet about my issue, and found out how you eat affects your results. I looked heavier due to when working out your body needs more fuel, so I ate everything, and that had to change.<br>So, phase II into trying to better my body, I continued the sit-ups and pushups with a little better eating habit. Days, then weeks, then months, and still, not what I want! I got really demotivated, I gave up for a few days, but then I would see those guys with muscles, and I would say, “They not better than me! I better get up and do something about this!” furiously talking to myself and self-shaming, until I started searching the internet for more information.<br>I found out about habits, food habits and workout habits. So, I used YouTube to my advantage and looked for workouts for my abdominal muscles, and my chest muscles, as I thought they were the only muscles you train. Along with bettering my eating habits, as I read online that the quality of food matters as much as the quantity. So, results started showing, but my body doesn’t look as good as how individuals look in the pictures, so I had to find out why! I found out that there are a lot of muscle groups to train! So, I started working or training those muscles, and obviously started eating better and I didn’t track my progress, as I thought it could demotivate me. Days passed, weeks passed, and months passed, and it was time to reveal my process. I was really counting on this, so I reveal, and there I was not believing what I am looking at! Finally, the long-awaited body, has finally arrived. Now, my new goal is keep improving my body shape, until the end of time. <br>My only goal is to improve my strength and improve my skills. I have encountered a group of skills, skills like writing skills, I have a teacher, who gives us writing essays-which I personally like. What really motivated me is, the last essay I submitted, I got top mark! Which was really motivating, motivating enough to make me write my own book, which never in a million years thought I would do. Usually I write something, its just a way of wasting time, but now, it became like an art, an art that only the artist understands.

				Chapter 4
				<br>
				Back To The Future
			</h1>
			<p>
				You read about my past, and read about the present day, but what about the future? What do I a seventeen-year-old young man, who likes to write and read-which isn’t normal for teenagers nowadays-want to do in the future? The past months, I have been thinking about this a lot. This matters because, it determines how high I aim to achieve in my marks. A few subjects come to mind when I think of my future, to be specific, three subjects or career paths. Law, software engineering, and security. Law, I have two reasons as of why; one is being a lawyer, and the other being a detective.<br>The reason I want to become a lawyer, is what you can do in a court of law. Proving your client is not guilty of a crime, or proving that a company wronged your company, or putting a criminal away and save future victims is a great thing. Watching TV shows and movies of lawyers really inspired me. I also like how the job can make you the person everyone needs. You make new friends; you get to meet important people.<br>Software engineering, or cyber-security. I had a teacher in grade seven who gave us coding HTML and CSS for those interested. I was way, way ahead of the whole grade! I would help the top students, but them being top students, learned quickly and there I had opponents. It was fun competing with them, I felt great competing with top students. Other then the fact of being ahead of the grade, I actually like coding, but when I see people coding programs, it looks hard and the code instantly become rocket-science, but only in this case, I would learn rocket-science. As I previously pointed, watching movies played a role into making or putting this idea into consideration. Unfortunately, this job is new, and people look at you like how they look at the nerds in school. Thankfully, this stereotype has started vanishing. Cyber-security is an amazing job title, due to modern day lifestyle, it all depends on technology, and being a solider in a internet battle, not only feels amazing, but also pays well, but if I don’t want to choose a path where it depends on money, even though I like it.<br>Although cyber-security is amazing, and getting justice served is astonishing, being an officer or a solider is an honor. Fighting crime or fighting the enemy, isn’t easy, and to serve your country like that is such an amazing thing to done, and such an honor. The reason I didn’t choose it already, it involves leaving your family for a long time, and potentially moving to a different part of the country. I learned that family is everything, family is the key to living a happy life. If I make that decision, I leave my family behind and start the life of honoring and protecting my country. <br>“Not every father gets a chance to start his son off in his footsteps.” Alan Ladd. My father has planted a seed in my head about becoming a doctor. Being a doctor, the savior of the people in need, is also an amazing job, title, and career path, but to be honest, becoming a doctor holds seven years of college, I might not be able to hold seven years of studying, I fear that I may get bored because of the long seven years and drop out into another career. But becoming a doctor is a seed that has been planted and I will keep watering it. <br>Back to the future. I made a decision, and went to college. What’s the college life like? College is the time to learn how to have fun and study and depend on yourself all at once, one can focus on one skill at a time or two skills or all of them. To become a great student, you should learn and try to master those skills as a high school student before becoming a college student. If you have fun all of your time and not focus as much on studying, you can lose out on a lot. You can literally destroy your future.<br>Enough with the teacher-student talk, it’s 2027 and I graduate college. <br>Finally after a long journey of not sleeping as much, and nothing but baring my head into books and essays and the all of that college problems, I am finished with it! My parents are smiling, their smiles can crack a window, my mother is in tears of joy. My father is proud of me, I couldn’t be anymore happier, my family is happy, my father is proud and now, I have a future.<br>I bet you’re thinking to yourself, what did I study? What did I take? I studied law. Now, after all the parties, its time to find myself a job. I decided to become a detective, so I go and apply to become one, they said, they will reply in a few days. A few days pass, as I am working out, having a great time, with a great pump going, I get a call. I pick up my phone, and it's an unknown number, I think to myself, should I pick up or ignore it? Then I remembered that I applied to a job, I picked up so fast, Flash-from Marvel- can’t keep up. They said they would love to interview me and see if I am fit for the job, I close the phone then in joy, I yell, “YES!” I kept the news to myself, as I wanted it to be a surprise. The job interview went great and they promised in a few days they would reply. A slow, devastating week goes by, and I get I call, I pick up without looking, but it was my father asking if we as a family go to the cinema, we start talking about where and how, then I get a call, I check, and its unknown, I instantly excuse myself from the call and pick up. It was a deliveryman, my brother ordered food, so I tell my brother about his food and laid down in sadness. After a few hours, I get a call, an unknown number, I pray to god its them, and thankfully and finally, it was them. And they accepted me in! I close the phone and just stared in happiness. So I organize a family day with my family and we went out and had fun. Then it was time to eat, so as everyone is enjoying their food, I deliver the great news, and there was my mother already in tears of joy and my father in disbelieve. Everyone was happy. And there I was, a detective and a great son that made his parents proud of him. My father in proudness promised an expensive gift, him and I go back and forth about an expensive gift isn’t necessary, my father used the father card, when he says something it happens. In a smiling and happiness moment, I gratefully thank him.<br>My first day in work, they assign me to the academy, which was not even on my mind, I didn’t think to become a detective you need to attend an academy. There was a fitness test you have to pass first, which I had no clue about, but thankfully, I train or workout so I have the confidence and the strength to pass. They set us on a line, like elementary students and gaves us instructions. After they finished giving us the questions to the test, we start doing our thing within pairs. I easily pass as what they assigned is basic to strength training. Unfortunately, I saw people fail the test which was sad and motivating, sad because, you say to yourself, what if that was me? And motivating because, you see how serious the instructors are and you don’t want to be in the shoes of those who fail. After they got everyone together, they set us home and told us to come back to tomorrow to complete the academy and if you’re a second late, you’re done. A few months later, I graduate the academy and finally become a detective, a real one. <br>At the beginning, we talked about my past, and how Canada was an inspiring chapter in my life and how coming back affected me and how others interacted with such a situation. And we talked about how events leading to the present day made me a better person, and how these events shaped my life. We also talked about the present day, and how I have no goals but to strengthen and improve my skills and how I plan to live my life. We also talked about the future, and how imaginative an individual can be. We also talked about how bright I hope my future will be.<br>Writing this book made me realize how writing can affect your brain, it makes you brainstorm ideas and force your brain to make or find new ideas. It also made me realize how writing about your past makes it amazing and living through good old memories can make an individual happy, and how talking about the bad events that happened in your life can be in a way therapeutic, it also showed me how one might hate something or just prefers not doing it, but he truly likes it and its one of his or her skills. You might have a skill that you think you hate or prefer not doing it, always try new things, if they don’t work out, then move on to the next, if it works, then improve it.
